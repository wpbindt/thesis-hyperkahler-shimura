\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
It takes a village to write a thesis. The purpose of this section is to acknowledge this fact. More importantly, its purpose is to acknowledge people that I love, and who contribute to making my life worth living.

{\bfseries Lenny}, I could not have wished for a better mentor. Coming to you with whatever problem I had invariably made the problem less bad. Your relentless optimism is painfully infective, and I hope to carry it for the rest of my life.

{\bfseries Brendan}, a while ago I made a directed graph of the people in my life I like, the edges signifying who I met through whom. Your efforts to socialize the department put you squarely at the top of the graph. Sujin, my past three apartments, the bulk of my friends: they can all be traced to you somehow. Thank you for being an excellent boating/climbing/brewery-touring buddy, and thank you for being the root of my digraph.

{\bfseries Sarah},

{\bfseries Bonanza},

{\bfseries Dani},

{\bfseries H\'el\`ene},

{\bfseries Madi}, I originally wanted to make your entire acknowledgement out of puns, but it was much harder than expected. I just couldn't quite fit them in. Thank you for all the movies, the chats, and for making me understand that life is pain au chocolat.

{\bfseries Beau Darius, Drugo, Gerald, Mulva, Omniscientis, Rhinoa, Vorondil},


{\bfseries Renjie and Zhou}, the first 23 years of my life were spent not knowing about Szechuan peppers. I will never get those years back. Meeting the two of you ended that dark period of my life, and for this I am eternally grateful. Thanks for all the wonderful dinners and laughs.


{\bfseries Chris}, thank you for popping my bouldering cherry. Bouldering with you was always a lot of fun.


{\bfseries Mees}, at the very start of my existence as a PhD student, you baked some brownies. They were lovely. Thank you.

{\bfseries Suhwa},



{\bfseries Bart, Jimme, Karin},

{\bfseries Sujin},

{\bfseries Max}, you called me up just to ask how I was doing, you gave me melatonin when you found out I was sleeping poorly, you gave me tips on vaginal hygiene. You were the sweetest big little brother. I would give anything for another chance at having you beat me up with a giant inflatable penis. Actually, I mainly wish you were still alive so we all wouldn't miss out on so much of you, and that I would've been around you more when you were alive. The penis thing is kind of secondary to that. Even though, as we both know, there is no such thing as an afterlife, picturing you looking down on us smugly from the danger zone while having us listen to Gerard Joling at your funeral will always make me laugh.
