\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Acknowledgements}
{\bfseries Lenny}, I could not have wished for a better mentor. Coming to you with whatever problem I had invariably made the problem less bad. Your relentless optimism is painfully infective, and I hope to carry it for the rest of my life.

{\bfseries Brendan}, I made a directed graph of the people in these acknowledgements, the edges signifying who I met through whom. Your efforts to socialize the department put you squarely at the top of the largest connected component of the graph. Thank you for the excellent boating, climbing, brewery-touring, and thank you for being the root of my digraph.

{\bfseries H\'el\`ene},

{\bfseries Lorenzo},

{\bfseries Madi}, I originally wanted to make your entire acknowledgement out of puns, but it was much harder than expected. I just couldn't quite fit them in. Thank you for all the movies, the chats, and for making me understand that life is pain au chocolat.

{\bfseries Sam}, thank you for allowing me to take shelter in the comfort of your various toilets.

{\bfseries Sarah},

{\bfseries Thibault}, thanks for being one of the main reasons conferences were fun to go to, and for providing me with a home away from home in Leiden. Here's to Fran\c{c}ois.

And many thanks go out to the people at the KdVI, for making my time there so enjoyable. I'm particularly thankful to {\bfseries Beau Darius, Drugo, Gerald, Mulva, Omniscientis, Rhinoa, and Vorondil}, and especially {\bfseries Fabian} for keeping them in check.  

{\bfseries Mees}, at the very start of my existence as a PhD student, you baked some brownies. They were lovely. Thank you.

{\bfseries Bart, Jimme, Karin} thank you for literally everything.

{\bfseries Sujin}, I could not have done this without you. 흰둥이.

{\bfseries Max}, you called me up just to ask how I was doing, you gave me melatonin when you found out I was sleeping poorly, you gave me tips on vaginal hygiene. You were the sweetest big little brother. I would give anything for another chance at having you beat me up with a giant inflatable chanticleer. Actually, I mainly wish you were still alive so we all wouldn't miss out on so much of you, and that I would've been around you more when you were alive. The chanticleer thing is kind of secondary to that. Even though, as we both know, there is no such thing as an afterlife, picturing you looking down on us smugly from the danger zone while having us listen to Gerard Joling at your funeral will always make me laugh.
